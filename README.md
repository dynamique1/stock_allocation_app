Deploying to GCP Cloud Run
Ensure Google Cloud SDK is installed and initialized:


gcloud init
Enable necessary APIs:


gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com
Build and push the Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR):


gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/stockapp-dockerfile .
Deploy the image to Cloud Run:


gcloud run deploy stock-allocation-app --image gcr.io/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/stockapp-dockerfile --platform managed --region [YOUR_REGION]
Configure deployment: Follow the prompts to set up the deployment. Upon success, you'll receive a URL for your deployed service.

Environment Variables
Make sure to set up a .env file with the necessary environment variables. An example .env file might look like this:



FLASK_APP=app.main
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

Usage
Once deployed, access your application via the URL provided by GCP Cloud Run. The application includes the following endpoints:

/: Home page
